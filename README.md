2.Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

`1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...`

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.
```python
a=0
b=1
c=0
d=0
while(c<4000000):
	c=a+b
	a=b
	b=c
	# print(c)
	if c%2==0:
		print(c)
		d=d+c
print(d)
```

3.The prime factors of 13195 are 5, 7, 13 and 29.

What is the largest prime factor of the number `600851475143` ?
```python
Number = 600851475143
for i in range(2, Number + 1):
    if(Number % i == 0):
        isprime = 1
        for j in range(2, (i //2 + 1)):
            if(i % j == 0):
                isprime = 0
                break    
        if (isprime == 1):
            print(i)
```

4.A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.

Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.
```python
def larrgestPalindrome(n):

	upper_limit = (10**(n))-1
	lower_limit = 1 + upper_limit//10
	max_product = 0
	for i in range(upper_limit,lower_limit-1, -1):
	
		for j in range(i,lower_limit-1,-1):
			product = i * j
			if (product < max_product):
				break
			number = product
			reverse = 0
			while (number != 0):
			
				reverse = reverse * 10 + number % 10
				number =number // 10
			if (product == reverse and product > max_product):
				max_product = product
	return max_product
n = 3
print(larrgestPalindrome(n))
```
5.2520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from 1 to 10 without any remainder.

What is the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to 20?
```python
import math
start = 2
end = 20
lst=[]
lst2=[]  
for i in range(start, end+1):
  if i>1:
    for j in range(2,i):
        if(i % j==0):
            break
    else:
        lst.append(i)
for i in lst:
	for j in range (1,10):
		if i**j>= end:
			lst2.append(i**(j-1))
			break
print(math.prod(lst2))
```

6.The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,

The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,

Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is .

Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.
```python
x=100
y=(x)*(x+1)*((2*x)+1)/6
z=((x)*(x+1)/2)**2
print(z-y)
```

7.By listing the first six prime numbers: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13, we can see that the 6th prime is 13.
What is the 10 001st prime number?
```python
import math
import itertools
def is_prime(n):
    for i in range(2,math.floor(math.sqrt(n)+1)):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
        else:
            continue
    return True
p = 0
for x in itertools.count(1):
    if is_prime(x):
        if p == 10001:
            print(x)
            break
        p += 1
(the time complixity is decreased by sqrt
```
